# Robotic Arm Control System

This project enables the control of a robotic arm using Arduino and servo motors. It involves the use of potentiometers to control the movement of the servo motors, allowing for precise manipulation of the robotic arm.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE should be installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming and circuit connections is required.
- Servo motors and potentiometers should be available for setting up the robotic arm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Connect the servo motors and potentiometers to the Arduino board as described in the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

- Adjust the potentiometers to control the movement of the servo motors.
- Observe the serial monitor to track the values corresponding to each servo.
- Customize the code to incorporate additional functionalities for the robotic arm.

## Circuit Diagram

Include a detailed circuit diagram showcasing the connections between the Arduino, servo motors, and potentiometers.
